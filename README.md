# 🦫 From BeaverTail to Invisible Ferret

*InvisibleFerret* is a Python-based malware designed for corporate espionage, capable of stealing sensitive files, clipboard data, and user credentials while targeting browser extensions like crypto wallets. It employs techniques like FTP for exfiltration, clipboard monitoring, and keylogging. It is deployed after *BeaverTail* and its part of the Contagious Interview / DevPopper campaign.

**PrettyVisibleFerret** is an expanded and annotated version of *InvisibleFerret*, created to improve readability and include debug output for better understanding of its behaviour.
